This project is the first tutorial project from the Udemy course [The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity (Official)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/)

I'll add notes here on any problems I had with this project... Over 97,000 students have taken the course so there shouldn't be anything new to see here, other than my bumbling mistakes and general confusion on becoming a game developer at my age.
